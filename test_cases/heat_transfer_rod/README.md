ReferenceExecutable Folder is the problem implemented in Su2/OpenFoam

LinkPrototype is our work to implement the problem in LINK.
	- drafts*.steel is code written in psuedo LINK syntax. Used by Yerim to describe the problem
	- compiles*.steel is code written with LINK syntax and is expected to compile
	- params*.steel is a set of commands we expect LINK to generate for the problem. This isn't code.
