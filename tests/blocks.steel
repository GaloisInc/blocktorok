-- This represents the rough shape of a typical LINK program. Every LINK
-- program consists of three sections:
--
-- 1. A global configuration
-- 2. One or more models
-- 3. Coupling configuration for every pair of models
--
-- Each of these is described below in comments like this one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The configuration block will set globally important parameters. Right now,
-- that's only the step size (no units support just yet) and a duration (either
-- a number of steps to take or a total time to run for). The order of things
-- (currently) matters, and we'll probably discover there are useful fields to
-- add here.
config : {
    step : 17
    totalTime : 10
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Models are introduced with the keyword `model` followed by an identifier
-- (starting with an alphabetic character followed by zero or more letters,
-- digits, underscores, or single-quotes). In braces will be the parameters
-- defining the model: For now, this is simply the solving technique. The
-- identifier can be thought of as the domain as one would seen in a typical
-- physics paper.
model A : { solve = FEM }

model B : { solve = FVM }

model C : { solve = FEM }

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The coupling blocks will effectively define the coordination between each
-- pair of models. The LINK compiler statically checks that for every pair of
-- models introduced above, there is a single coupling block. Coupling blocks
-- will contain the equations governing the behavior at the interface between
-- the two models and any other information necessary to communicate data
-- between the models as appropriate. A coupling is introduced with the keyword
-- `couple` followed by two identifiers (that must have been introduced above).
-- In braces will be fields defining the coupling parameters (currently,
-- nothing).
couple A B : { }
couple A C : { }
couple B C : { }
