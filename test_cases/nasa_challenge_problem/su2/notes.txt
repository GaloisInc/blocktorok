Note. Yerim wants to add the following attributes to the Su2 command for the challenge problem:
	MATH_PROBLEM= DIRECT -- I ADDED THIS, THIS NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE
	RESTART_SOL= NO -- THIS COULD BE HARD CODED AND SKIPPED





-- unsteady/transient simulation
TimeDependency { 
  TIME_DOMAIN = YES;
  TIME_MARCHING= DUAL_TIME_STEPPING-2ND_ORDER;
  INNER_ITER= 50;
  OUTER_ITER = 1000;
}


Only supported by the following built-in keyword GridDeformation which will generate
Fixing grid deformations

GridDeformation {
  DEFORM_LINEAR_SOLVER= FGMRES;
  DEFORM_LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 200;
  DEFORM_NONLINEAR_ITER= 1;
  DEFORM_CONSOLE_OUTPUT= YES;
  DEFORM_STIFFNESS_TYPE= INVERSE_VOLUME;
}
