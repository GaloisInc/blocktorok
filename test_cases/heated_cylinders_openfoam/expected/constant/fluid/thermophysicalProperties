// herhothermo: fluid with fixed chemical composition, calculates the basic thermodynamic 
//properties based on density variation of the fluid, ùúå. This is used in heat transfer analyses
//where the density of the fluid is changing due to changes in its temperature.

//thermophysical models without reactions is pureMixture, which represents a mixture with
//fixed composition. When pureMixture is specified, 
//the thermophysical models coefficients are specified within a sub-dictionary called mixture.

//The transport modelling concerns evaluating dynamic viscosity Œº, thermal conductivity Œ∫ and
//thermal diffusivity Œ± (for internal energy and enthalpy equations).
// **constant: assumes constant viscosity and constant prandtl number**

//The thermodynamic models are concerned with evaluating the specific heat cp from which other
//properties are derived. 

//Hf (heat of fusion) for dry air = 0
//Hf is the heat of fusion. It is however not used if sensibleEnthalpy or sensibleInternalEnergy is specified. 
//This quantity only applies to totalEnthalpy etc. ... Nevertheless a value must be present. 
//Which value is choosen does not affect your simulation results since it is not used to calculate any quantity.
